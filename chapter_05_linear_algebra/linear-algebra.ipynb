    "## Vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental building blocks of linear algebra are **vectors**. Vectors are defined as \n",
    "quantities having both **direction** and **magnitude** (length), compared to scalar quantities that \n",
    "only have magnitude. In order to have direction and magnitude, vector quantities consist of two or \n",
    "more elements of data. The **dimensionality of a vector** is determined by the number of numerical \n",
    "elements in that vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s take a look at examples of a scalar versus a vector. A car driving at a speed of 40mph is a \n",
    "scalar quantity. Describing the car driving 40mph to the east would represent a two-dimensional \n",

    "\n",
    "The magnitude (or length) of a vector, ||v||, can be calculated with the following formula:\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "||v|| = $ \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^n{v_i^2}} $\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is grounded in the **Pythagorean theorem**, especially in 2D and 3D space. For \n",
    "instance, in a 2D space, if you consider a vector $ (v_1, v_2) $ as forming a right-angled \n",
    "triangle with the axes, the magnitude represents the hypotenuse, and the Pythagorean theorem applies.\n",

    "## Basic Vector operations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scalar multiplication\n",
    "\n",
    "Any vector can be multiplied by a scalar, which results in every element of that vector being \n",

    "## Vector Dot Products (Scalar Product)\n",
    "\n",
    "An important vector operation in linear algebra is the dot product. A dot product takes two equal \n",

    "<br>\n",
    "$ a \\cdot b = \\sum_{i=1}^n{a_i*b_i} $\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting scalar value represents how much one vector “goes into” the other vector. If two \n",
    "vectors are orthogonal (perpendicular), their dot product is equal to 0, as neither vector “goes \n",
    "into the other.”\n",
    "\n",
    "The dot product can also be used to find the magnitude of a vector and the angle between two \n",
    "vectors. To find the magnitude, we can see that the magnitude of a vector is simply the square root \n",
    "of a vector’s dot product with itself.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "||v|| = $ \\sqrt{v \\cdot v} $\n",
